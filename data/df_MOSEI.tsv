kiR5zVo2zvU[1],not it this sp can sp apply sp to sp everything sp whether sp it is sp sending an sp email blast sp to your list sp that you haven't talked to in two years sp or starting sp a sp channel sp or sp running an ad campaign sp for your next record that's sp coming out sp just sp start sp i think,1.67,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0

kiR5zVo2zvU[3],accountability sp can you hold yourself accountable to do the goals sp that you want sp because sp we all sp sort of by sp default if sp things get sp stressful sp don't do stuff sp and so,1.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
kiR5zVo2zvU[4],stuff sp and so how can you kind of trick your brain to make it happen sp accountability and one way that i've done sp that sp to just sp set a schedule sp maybe,1.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

kiR5zVo2zvU[8],person sp could maybe be your publicist or your manager if you have the relationship where you're talking regularly sp check in and have them sort of sp hold you responsible that you get sp stuff sp done before your next call with them and it's sort of like sp you've got that sp assignment sp,1.33,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
kiR5zVo2zvU[9],sp but if you don't have sp that you could also just sp create that with sp other members sp of sp your ensemble maybe you delegate who works sp on which things and you have a weekly check in meeting amongst sp all of you to sp see if everybody's doing what they need to be doing and how you can do better the next week sp,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

qDIh6YNbIMU[3],possible sp meaning sp that sp between each sp si and ti sp we sp want to sp send a flow sp that satisfies sp all of the edge capacities sp but,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
qDIh6YNbIMU[4],capacities sp but at the same time this flow can allocate one unit of sp processing to sp one of sp the sp that it goes through sp,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

B1B71X_SmwY[0],so impact sp investing is sp investing to make social change sp using something other than a grant sp so,1.67,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[1],grant sp so it could be a loan sp it could be an equity investment it could be a guarantee there's lots of ways you can structure it sp the,0.33,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[2],world sp so terms of sp transfer impact investing sp it's definitely growing a lot there's a lot of interest sp a lot of sp banks are coming into it you see a lot of philanthropists sp who want to sp find ways sp to do impact investments overall sp and so,1.33,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[3],overall sp and so what we see is sp a sp new products being created new opportunities but sp most of it is still sp it's still early days i would say sp and so sp you can look to your financial advisor you can look to your philanthropic advisor sp for opportunities that they may have for you to get involved sp you sp,1.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[4],to get involved sp you sp know i strongly believe that philanthropy is about sp expressing sp your passion sp expressing your view for what the world can be sp and sp from sp what i've seen it's really important for people to keep sp that connection sp and keep that flame sp lit sp so,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[5],lit sp so obviously you can give sp but sp my sp advice would be to always stay close to sp the work stay close to,1.33,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[6],sp the work stay close to the people sp who are trying to help sp are sp not only sp for your own sp motivation but because you'll learn sp and through that connection sp more change will happen whether that's sp,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

B1B71X_SmwY[8],involved sp the gentleman named bryan stevenson sp who has founded sp equal justice initiative a sp top piece of advice that i've heard him give which i really embrace is to get sp proximate sp to a problem sp so many of,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[9],problem sp so many of the challenges in the world today are because there's so much separation sp and sp it's up to each of us individually to overcome sp that separation sp so,1.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

B1B71X_SmwY[11],structure it sp the way i like to think about it is sp can you broaden your tool chest sp chest beyond grant making sp but still be thinking sp about sp the kind of investment that you're making sp so sp,1.67,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[12],that you're making sp so sp impact investment sp should not be seen as a substitute sp for philanthropy but rather an additional thing that you can do and sp,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[13],thing that you can do and sp obviously the difference is when you make a grant sp you give money sp hopefully sp something very good happens sp in the world sp but,1.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[14],world sp but sp if that sp thing needs to happen again sp you or somebody else needs to give another sp grant sp at,0.67,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[15],grant sp at its best sp what sp you can do with an impact investment sp is sp deploy that capital that capital can be used by sp either nonprofit or for profit to do the work that they do sp,1.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[16],sp but then sp that sp capital can be recycled sp and so hopefully they sp will not always need another grant another grant to keep on doing the good work that they do sp yeah so what,0.67,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[17],that they do sp yeah so what acumen does is we are investing in entrepreneurial solutions to poverty sp we do,1.67,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
B1B71X_SmwY[18],poverty sp we do that primarily by investing in early stage companies that serve sp poor customers sp and also investing in leaders sp who we think and make a difference in the world sp so,1.33,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

GpRDC-S88dM[4],sp my next goal for sp is something sp that sounds quite simple sp but i think it's quite a challenge and i think it's sp something that sp everybody has sp to work on on some level sp and that's be nice to everybody sp,0.33,1.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
GpRDC-S88dM[5],sp now that sp sounds quite simple when i'm in a good mood sp but i want to be more conscious of how i make people feel sp when i'm in a bad mood because sometimes i snap sp sometimes i'm grumpy sp you know everybody has sp those moments sp,0.67,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

266852[17],sp because sp the movie sp umm sp yeah the most important thing i wanna share about this is that sp the starting of the movie sp it just happened like sp real fun that something is happening something is sp happening it's not like sp you set a bag down and then sp start on sp the storyline sp,-0.33,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

cOcNe3L4VAg[1],important sp first you might be asking what is martech sp well it's when marketing and technology come together to sp help us automate sp processes sp to help us aggregate data to look at the sp business sp and to really start sp to understand that customer experience from the sp first sp to the sp last we want to talk,1.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[2],sp message sp the third reason sp is that marketing connect the dots between marketing and operations sp finally,2.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[3],operations sp finally those that are selling the business promises and those that are executing on the business promises sp are looking at the same data sp the same business goals and are really able to create more unified business decisions to help them reach those sp the fourth,1.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[4],reach those sp the fourth reason sp is that martech lets you market sp smarter by having,1.33,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[5],smarter by having all of these platforms integrated we're able to sp see where we can sp automate processes to help streamline and create efficiencies sp since,0.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[6],efficiencies sp since everything is integrated sp we can adopt processes faster sp adopt trends sp faster sp and sp scale those marketing efforts to get sp to market faster ultimately,1.67,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[7],faster ultimately instead of all this data sp we're able to spend sp time strategically looking at the data and sp making business decisions that can really impact the bottom line sp thank you,1.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[8],sp last we want to talk through four reasons why martech is important the first,1.33,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[9],important the first is that martech really puts a priority on sp systems integrations sp or martech sp stacks sp,1.33,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[10],sp what's a martech sp stack sp it's sp when you can visually represent and sp categorize sp all of the different marketing technology platforms your company uses sp,0.67,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[11],sp you really start seeing where things are integrated sp and where there are holes sp the second,1.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[12],there are holes sp the second reason is that martech sp really looks at the whole customer journey so sp from that,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
cOcNe3L4VAg[13],customer journey so sp from that sp first sp to the sp last sp how are customers experiencing your brand sp by having integrated platforms sp we're able to create sp smarter and more strategic and personalized campaigns sp so it's,0.33,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

bU6CgE_kMRY[1],that way sp i am going to go a head and recommend sp it sp provided that you don't buy anything i don't know how long this will last sp because as more and more people come in to it sp and they don't charge anything for it they are ether going to have to charge sp or do sp something sp to raise money sp i don't think the revenue sp created will support it the other thing i wanted,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0

fW1pK2L6RgM[3],sp so i don't pull any punches sp the sp way that i approach it is sp i am essentially sp consulting with sp the patients and the patient needs to become an sp expert sp in whatever sp disease they might have whatever problem it might be sp,0.33,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33
fW1pK2L6RgM[4],sp to do that they need to have all of the information necessary sp and so sp they need to know exactly what i am thinking sp,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33

fW1pK2L6RgM[6],sp we might need a little more information than we can collect in the office sp but usually by the second visit sp we can have a pretty good idea sp what sp we are in for sp is there something more that needs to be done sp,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

he475nnmMi0[3],sp the easiest way to eliminate that is to sp take out a loan sp using that car as collateral sp so,1.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
he475nnmMi0[4],collateral sp so if you take out a loan on the sp car sp using the car as sp collateral sp then we end up with sp a car sp minus the sp owed sp leaving of sp equity sp and of sp automobile exemption sp so sp there is no non exempt equity sp in the sp car sp,-0.33,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

he475nnmMi0[9],it sp so if somebody sp owns a car sp worth and sp they have sp a car loan sp minus the sp equity in the car sp is so what sp do we do in a situation sp where the amount of equity in the sp car sp is greater than the amount of exemption sp that we have to apply sp to it sp because,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lp9vkkimXqg[0],sp hi i am going to sp review cosmetics products sp the first,1.33,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[1],products sp the first one is sp this sp hyaluronic acid sp serum sp,0.67,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[2],up sp it is not heavy it's not oily sp or sticky or sp in sp any way sp it's very light sp but at the same time sp works sp very well in tightening your sp skin up sp so i love sp it the second sp serum sp is sp the c booster which again by the way got absorbed sp very quickly and is not oily at all sp makes my sp skin feel very hydrated sp and less sp thin so to speak sp it kind,1.33,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[3],speak sp it kind sp of renews it and fills it with moisture sp and,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[4],moisture sp and the skin just feels smooth and hydrated and silky sp and,0.67,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[5],silky sp and the day cream sp works sp great for me because well sp i have sp dry skin sp and i need a sp fair amount of moisture sp,1.33,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[6],sp i put it on after the serum in the morning sp it has,0.67,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[7],morning sp it has both vitamin c and hyaluronic acid in it by the way sp,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[8],sp so it kind sp of sp finishes of the facial sp treatment sp and it boosts sp the moisture up sp,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[9],sp and sp it lasts sp throughout the day which is important for me because sp i don't have to worry about my skin until the evening treatment sp,1.67,2.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[10],sp i really enjoy these products sp,1.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[11],sp i recommend them especially if you would like sp to firm sp your skin up sp or sp if you have sp a more dry type of skin sp like i have sp,0.67,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[12],sp the sp second one is the sp c booster serum vitamin sp c booster sp serum sp the third sp,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lp9vkkimXqg[13],sp so this sp serum sp is just like a moisture injection sp for your skin leaves your skin sp firm sp hydrated sp and relaxed sp and comfortable and together with the day cream sp also radiant sp and it sp finishes of sp the treatment sp very nicely sp like i've said sp so,2.0,1.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lp9vkkimXqg[15],sp first of sp all let me say i have a sp fairly dry sp skin and that means sp that because of that in the sp t area of my sp face i notice how my pores sp just seem bigger sp than the pores sp in the other parts of my sp face and sp i've,-1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

F59hwsm4Ld0[6],that nature sp the absolute first question you need to be asking sp is is the sp biggest sp safety question sp number two is is the biggest sp monetary fix that you what is the biggest monetary item sp out there and this one can be a little bit tricky because sp the home inspector might not know the exact sp cost sp but they are certainly going to know the most significant item sp that,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0

4Kh5N9W-Jr4[3],vs sp now i refer to both of these terms quite a lot when i'm doing the trend analysis and looking at the sales data sp so i thought it would be good sp good idea to make sure that we're on the same page with what this means sp averages,0.67,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
4Kh5N9W-Jr4[4],means sp averages sp very simple sp take the total sales and divide by the count sp and that gives you a number that is the average sp now,0.67,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

4Kh5N9W-Jr4[7],median sp now they are much less skewed are much less skewed sp by really giant sales sp at the top end sp and so that sometimes sp is a much sp better sp indicator of what you might expect to get sp for one of your names sp on a typical sp sale sp,0.33,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

E0g6nae4Ae4[1],derose sp the community director of the counterparty foundation sp and today sp i wanted to answer the question sp what sp is a sp a sp is sp a new kind of term and we know what traditional equities are sp we think sp,0.33,2.67,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,1.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[2],to sp do you can define shares you can define the name of sp your company as an asset name and sp you can declare that to the network and you can declare that as having sp x number of shares maybe you sp have,1.33,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[3],number of shares maybe you sp have sp shares or shares sp,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[4],sp maybe these are non divisible shares sp thee sp are sp non divisible in the sense that they don't have sub units they are just tokens,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,1.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[5],sub units they are just tokens sp that are themselves a percentage of a sp a sp whole sp those would be,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[6],sp whole sp those would be sp a very bare bones definition of what a is sp but it goes a sp little bit sp further from there sp can,0.67,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[7],there sp can sp also be things like sp tied sp to tangible sp goods maybe you have,0.67,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[8],tangible sp goods maybe you have a sp bank of sp gold or copper or some such thing sp and you want to declare to the network that you are the holder of that repository sp that it is yours sp but the equity itself sp is decentralized sp and it is sp declared on the network and it sp represents some sp fractional holding of that store sp of that traditional commodity sp in some,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[9],commodity sp in some senses in that case it's a bit centralized and requires sp trust upon sp the person declaring the asset sp but certainly is doesn't require trust sp on the part of the clearinghouse or the counterparty agent sp,0.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[10],sp that would be another use for sp but sp there's more exotic definitions sp of as well sp these,0.67,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[11],well sp these could be things such as sp karma perhaps sp maybe what,1.33,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[12],equities are sp we think sp that are sp going to be something pretty different sp there's,1.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[13],perhaps sp maybe what you do is on a sp type site sp you issue karma for people who contribute content sp this,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[14],content sp this content is itself sp a fractional share of perhaps the advertising revenue that would also,0.67,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[15],revenue that would also be a new form of and we don't really know where this is going but these are the types of things that people can start doing with counterparty with and these are the types of directions that people will take right,0.67,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[16],people will take right now there is a sp project which is a bridge between the old world of equities and the new world of sp that project,1.33,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[17],world of sp that project is still sp in development it's too soon to talk about and we will see what happens but sp you'll start to see the divide between equity sp in traditional sp shares and safe sp models sp and the model start to blur perhaps over time sp what we can be,1.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[18],time sp what we can be certain of is that are sp decentralized sp they,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[19],decentralized sp they are sp tied sp to sp the security of the network sp in terms of a sp scarcity sp and sp they will be sp available through protocols like sp if not certainly sp counterparty sp and they will be done by people like yourselves sp so go ahead and sp create your sp own sp show,1.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
E0g6nae4Ae4[20],own sp show us how this is going to work in sp the modern world sp and show us what you're doing with it in fact sp,0.67,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,1.0
