X2Hs89fZ2-c[0],sp in sp this module we're are focusing specifically on spatial data sp,0.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[1],sp we start by taking a little bit of a refresher sp on the three components of the sp software sp now,0.33,0.33,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.67
X2Hs89fZ2-c[2],sp and pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models sp,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33
X2Hs89fZ2-c[3],sp the last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to and in general sp,0.33,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.67
X2Hs89fZ2-c[4],software sp make sp sure you understand the difference between layers and features sp and and feature classes classes and feature classes sp and feature sp we also,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33
X2Hs89fZ2-c[5],sp allows us to display these not features sp for example population of the state sp population change sp what else can we display sp disease rates all of these,1.33,1.33,0.67,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.67
X2Hs89fZ2-c[6],software sp now in sp module you were exposed to sp and so sp,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33
X2Hs89fZ2-c[7],disease rates all of these things can be sp stored within the data as an attribute table can be displayed this is,0.33,0.33,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.67
X2Hs89fZ2-c[8],displayed this is what makes sp software so sp powerful sp it is also sp in this section we also talk about knowing how sp good quality your data are sp so,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[9],data are sp so sp making sure we know where to sp find what types of sp makes sp your data better or sp how sp do we understand who sp produced the data what the projection was so we sp,1.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[10],five sp and in this class sp we really only use or feature sp classes so make,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[11],classes so make sure sp that you understand what sp separates and feature classes sp feature classes are stored in are sp not make sure you understand,0.0,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33
X2Hs89fZ2-c[12],and so sp you should remember that sp is the main component sp of this is where,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[13],one file sp if sp you open up your open up your window explorer files versus opening sp it sp up in sp you will,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[14],sp up in sp you will see you have several files sp associated with each sp data set sp so,0.33,0.67,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.67
X2Hs89fZ2-c[15],set sp so sp pay attention to the files that are associated with it sp and how to move data from place to place regardless of the data format we're looking at sp,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[16],sp of this is where you create your sp data sp edit data view data analyze your map create maps sp it sp is sp the workhorse of the program sp,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[17],sp the second sp component is is more focused on database management sp so you should remember sp how you search through sp the different sp change projection sp added sp everything like sp that sp,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
X2Hs89fZ2-c[18],sp and then the last part sp the last component sp is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course where we get,0.0,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33
X2Hs89fZ2-c[19],the course where we get into looking at sp very specific tools sp,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

nbru7qLot04[8],in why you're going to be able to get sp financing on a sp home sp after bankruptcy it's important to understand sp what banks consider when determining whether or not to loan you money,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

P0UHzR4CmYg[0],sp one of the top questions i consistently get asked is sp how do i scale my engagement across social sp see managing large communities or listening all the time it's sp time consuming sp and we've developed so many time saving apps and software to help us automate the process sp but sp herein lies the distinction sp processes,1.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[1],distinction sp processes can be automated sp but one conversations meant to relationship build sp cannot sp,1.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[2],sp for instance when you're doing e mail triage every morning do sp you question whether a particular e mail is from a real person sp or is it an e mail blast that's been personalized to you sp are you suspicious of the ads that you see are even re targeted sp or do you stop looking at your direct messages on sp because sp all you seem to receive are automated messages sp your audience is just as sick of being bombarded with automation as you are sp and in this discussion of automation sp let's sp also consider the human error factor sp,0.33,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[3],sp currently there is no automated system that prevents humans from making mistakes or social sp errors online sp,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[4],sp and as sp companies we've been used to having a little space between sp developing content and distributing it sp but,1.0,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[5],it sp but digital sharing sp especially immediacy of social sp has made many of us wish there were more filters in place sp to prevent sp human mistakes from coming in sp,0.67,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[6],sp so where should we draw the line sp people want us to be more human online sp but part of the discomfort many companies have with sp embracing social business sp is the possibility of embarrassment sp due to that human error sp,-0.33,1.0,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33
P0UHzR4CmYg[7],sp see some of the errors committed online by corporations have been more than just embarrassing sp they've,-0.67,1.67,0.0,0.33,0.0,0.33,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[8],embarrassing sp they've been career ending sp,-1.33,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[9],sp however companies are learning to demonstrate humanity sp rather than knee jerk reactions to save face sp,2.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[10],sp that's a good thing sp in,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[11],thing sp in the corporate world sp there's still a little too much sp emphasis on appearing perfect sp,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[12],sp the bottom line is that meaningful one conversations require human interaction sp and a personal touch sp,0.67,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[13],sp people are surprisingly forgiving brands when they own up to mistakes sp and unfortunately some haters out there sp love to point sp fingers and jump sp all over imperfections sp but for the most part people understand sp people,0.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[14],sp so sometimes however sp the tools we use to sp automate some of our content distribution and sharing processes sp can exacerbate a mistake sp,1.33,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[15],sp it's the blending of the two that's an sp art form sp and it's sp always evolving sp,0.67,1.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[16],sp see when you can automate in the right places sp the human touch points within any campaign sp product release sp or general sharing system sp you've hit the jackpot sp and,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[17],jackpot sp and to achieve this we use the rule of sp thirds to split between automation sp sharing and one interaction sp,0.67,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
P0UHzR4CmYg[18],sp this sp will make the difference for companies and for people sp i,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
